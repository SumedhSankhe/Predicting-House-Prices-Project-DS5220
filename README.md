# Predicting-House-Prices-Project-DS5220

### Problem Description:  
When a buyer is asked to describe their dream house, they probably would begin with the number of bedrooms, availability of white picket fence, number of floors etc. and not the height of basement ceiling or the proximity to a train station. From this project, we aim to prove that much more influences price negotiations than the features mentioned above.

### Problem:   
To build models to predict house prices, given the Ames (Iowa) Housing dataset, with high degree of predictive accuracy

### Significance:  
The goal of the problem is to utilize machine learning tools to make the best possible prediction of house prices. This is an interesting problem because most people will eventually buy/sell a home. This problem allows us, as data scientists, to learn more about the housing market and helps with making more informed decisions.
